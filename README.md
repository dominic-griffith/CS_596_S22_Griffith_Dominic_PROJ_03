Project 3, Flocking Behavior Artificial Intelligence (AI),  250 pts

 

Implement a fully functional 3D simulation which implements flocking behavior. Your simulation must have a GUI which can change the flocking behavior between the following three modes, Lazy Flight, Circle a Tree, Follow the Leader.

 

The three modes are described here:

Lazy Flight , the flocking AI will choose a random point to fly towards within your scene. When the destination is reached, a new target within the limits of the scene is chosen and the flock flies towards that.
Circle a Tree, the flocking AI controller will follow a pre-specified set of waypoints to flock to. The set of waypoints may be thought of as some closed shape such as a figure eight or a circle.
Follow the Leader, the flocking AI controller will follow a clearly marked target. Extra credit will be given for a user controlled character that the flock may follow.
 

Undergraduate students must implement the Lazy Flight mode and one advanced target mode 2 or 3.

Graduate students must implement all three flocking behaviors.

 

You may submit your own version of the flocking behavior games from the Unity AI Game Programming Textbook. Or you may submit a game of your own design. 

Due date: Feb 26,  2022 at 1250PM. Turn in your project via rijeka.sdsu.edu version control server.
